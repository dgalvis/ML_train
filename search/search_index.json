The goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. This type of learning is a form of predictive modelling, where models are trained on historical data to make predictions about new, unseen data.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#examples-of-supervised-learning","title":"\ud83d\udd0d Examples of Supervised Learning","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Forecasting energy consumption   A model is trained on a dataset containing daily energy usage over the course of a year. It then predicts energy usage for future days based on patterns it has learned.   \u2192 This is an example of regression, because the target output (energy usage) is a continuous variable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Email spam detection   A model is trained on a labeled dataset of emails, where each email is marked as spam or not spam. The model learns to classify new, unseen emails accordingly.   \u2192 This is an example of classification, because the target output is a categorical variable (e.g., {\"spam\", \"not spam\"} or {0, 1}).</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#regression","title":"\ud83d\udcc8 Regression","text":"<p>Regression analysis refers to a family of methods used to estimate the relationship between a continuous dependent variable (also called the output, response, or label) and one or more independent variables (also called features, predictors, or regressors).</p>"},{"location":"index.html#regression-examples","title":"\ud83d\udd0d Regression Examples","text":"<ul> <li>Linear Regression</li> <li>(More examples coming soon)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#classification","title":"\ud83e\uddee Classification","text":"<p>Classification is the task of predicting categorical labels from input data.
